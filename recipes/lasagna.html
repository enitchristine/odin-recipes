            <li>kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 can of crushed tomato</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 package of whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/4 grated parmesan</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
                Lightly oil a 9 x 13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles
                 according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. 
                Add ground beef and onion and cook 
                until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble 
                the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. 
                Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 
                lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. 
                Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 
                1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.*</li>
            <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, 
                or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes,
                 or until top is browned in spots. 
                Let cool 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
